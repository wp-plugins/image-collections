WordPress image uploader and organizer.

== Description ==

### Image uploader and organizer.

If you want to create group of images and keep them in a separate folder this plugin is for you.

The plugin is intended for WordPress theme and plugin developers who are looking for a better way to work with sets of images.

For working examples of how to use Image Collections in other plugins, see:

* **[Fullscreen Slides](http://abcfolio.com/help/wordpress-plugin-fullscreen-slides/)**
* **[Andora Lightbox](http://wordpress.org/plugins/andora-lightbox/)**

In both cases, Image Collections plugin is used as an image uploader and organizer. You may find the concept of custom image management a familiar one if you ever worked with NexGEN Gallery plugin.

Plugin has an administration interface to handle image upload and management. There is no front-end presentation layer. Custom coding is required to use images in posts or plugins.

Image Collections plugin uses custom tables not linked to WordPress Media Library. Images are stored in individual folders outside the Media Library. Optimized data storage provides excellent performance even with large number of records.

**Collection**: set of images stored in its own folder.

### Features

* Each collection has a name and description
* Each collection stores images in its own folder.
* Each collection has its own set of options.
* Each collection has its own image dimensions.
* Up to two image sizes: large and thumbnail.
* Add title, alt and caption to each of the images.
